## Scientific background

The Wachtenlab studies **cellular communication and signaling**, with a particular emphasis on:

- Primary cilia and ciliary signaling  
- Immune and non-immune cell interactions  
- Optogenetics and biosensor development  
- Quantitative imaging and biophysical approaches  

The code shared here supports these research areas but may also be useful beyond them.
